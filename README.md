Abstract:

This chapter thoroughly examines soil threats and trends in Southern Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean, emphasizing their implications for sustainable land management. Through a comprehensive analysis of available data and literature, the study identifies erosion patterns, soil carbon changes, soil biodiversity indicators, nutrient mismanagement, salinization, sodification, and soil moisture decline as prominent concerns. Erosion is a significant issue, exacerbated by bare soil conditions, coastal erosion due to rising sea levels, and wind erosion influenced by land use and vegetation cover. Soil carbon changes exhibit both sequestration and loss patterns, particularly impacting agricultural soils, while soil biodiversity's role in nutrient cycling underscores the need for enhanced preservation efforts. Nutrient mismanagement, exemplified by fertilizer consumption trends and efficiency, underscores the importance of informed decision-making in optimizing soil fertility. In response to human activities, soil salinization and sodification significantly threaten agricultural sustainability, particularly across coastal areas. Soil moisture decline, linked to land use intensification and extreme climate events, further exacerbates soil degradation risks. The chapter concludes by advocating for comprehensive soil monitoring and management strategies to address these threats, which are crucial for safeguarding soil health, preserving ecosystem services, and ensuring long-term food security in the region.
